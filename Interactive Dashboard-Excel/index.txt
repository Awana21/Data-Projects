Excel Viewer & Data Entry Form Application

Overview: The Excel Viewer & Data Entry Form application is a user-friendly tool developed using the tkinter library and openpyxl to provide users with the ability to view and enter data into an Excel spreadsheet. The application offers a combination of features, including a data entry form, an Excel viewer, and a dark/light theme toggle.

The Employment field is a checkbox indicating whether the individual is employed or unemployed.
Inserting Data: The "Insert" button triggers the insertion of entered data into both the Excel sheet and the displayed table. After insertion, the form fields are cleared for the user's convenience.
